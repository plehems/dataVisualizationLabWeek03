## Research and understand Australia Energy Data Dictionary for TVs labelled

# Data visualization TO3: Communicating Data Insights
## Step 1: Who is the Audience? 
The primary audience for this visualization are **Australian Consumers** who are looking to purchase a television and are concerned about **energy efficiency and cost saving**. Secondary audience include **retailers** intrested in the popular brand and products.

### Audience characteristics
- Limited technical expertise where consumers much prefer simple charts rather then raw data.
- Intrested in practical insights such as TV brands, models and screen technologies that are most energy efficiency
- Likely motivated by reducing **eletricity bills** with better star rating

### Guidelines for the story
- Use plain language to explain visualizations (avoid using abbreviation)
- Emphasize comparion
- Focus on 6 or 7 insights without overwhelming the audiences
- Present the story in a logical flow where it starts from TVs availability -> size -> brands -> energy usage -> star rating
- All data visualizations must be filtered to display only the top 10 most relevant data points to remove low-impact data to ensure the narrative easy to disgest.

## Step 2: What Do They Want to Know?

### Audience mainly wants answer to
- **Screen Technologies**: What TV technologies (LCD, OLED, Plasma, etc.) are available in Australia, and which are most common?
- **Screen Sizes**: What screen sizes are on the market, and which are most popular?
- **Brands**: Which brands offer the most models and variety?
- **Power Consumptions**: Which screen technology uses the least power when in use (avg_mode_power)?
- **Screen Size vs Power Use**: Is there a clear relationship between TV size and electricity use?
- **Star Rating**: How does star rating (Star2/SRI) relate to screen size and power usage?

### What's important to them
- Knowing which TVs will cost less to  run over time
- Identify which brands and models balance with energy efficiency
- Understanding wheter buying a bigger TV always meas worse energy efficiency
- Clear recommendations
