## About the Data
### Data Source
The dataset was obtained from the Australian Governement open data portal
- [Data Source](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/energy-rating-for-household-appliances/resource/93a615e5-935e-4713-a4b0-379e3f6dedc9)
- [Data Dictionary](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/energy-rating-for-household-appliances/resource/8b0450be-2cc6-4f5d-b885-4f1e0fb9ee64)

### Data processing

### Privacy
- The dataset contains no personally identifiable information (PII).
- It only includes product-level details (e.g. brand, model, technical specifications, efficiency ratings).
- Since it is publicly available government data, there are no privacy risks.

### Accuracy and Limitations
- The dataset reflects product registrations as of September 2015 and may not include the latest television models.
- Star ratings and energy consumption values are based on standardized government testing procedures, which may not reflect real-world household usage conditions.

### Ethics
- The data is intended for consumer transparency and helps Australians make informed decisions about energy-efficient TVs.
- Using this dataset for visualisation supports sustainability goals by encouraging awareness of energy consumption and strengthen Australia Energy Efficiency (E3) Program.
- Any form of baise is excluded from this data visualization.

## Data Story
### Who is the Audience? 
The primary audience for this visualization are **Australian Consumers** who are looking to purchase a television and are concerned about **energy efficiency and cost saving**. Secondary audience include **retailers** intrested in the popular brand and products.

#### Audience characteristics
- Limited technical expertise where consumers much prefer simple charts rather then raw data.
- Intrested in practical insights such as TV brands, models and screen technologies that are most energy efficiency
- Likely motivated by reducing **eletricity bills** with better star rating

#### Guidelines for the story
- Use plain language to explain visualizations (avoid using abbreviation)
- Emphasize comparion
- Focus on 6 or 7 insights without overwhelming the audiences
- Present the story in a logical flow where it starts from TVs availability -> size -> brands -> energy usage -> star rating
- All data visualizations must be filtered to display only the top 10 most relevant data points to remove low-impact data to ensure the narrative easy to disgest.

### What Do They Want to Know?

#### Audience mainly wants answer to
- **Screen Technologies**: What TV technologies (LCD, OLED, Plasma, etc.) are available in Australia, and which are most common?
- **Screen Sizes**: What screen sizes are on the market, and which are most popular?
- **Brands**: Which brands offer the most models and variety?
- **Power Consumptions**: Which screen technology uses the least power when in use (avg_mode_power)?
- **Screen Size vs Power Use**: Is there a clear relationship between TV size and electricity use?
- **Star Rating**: How does star rating (Star2/SRI) relate to screen size and power usage?

#### What's important to them
- Knowing which TVs will cost less to  run over time
- Identify which brands and models balance with energy efficiency
- Understanding wheter buying a bigger TV always meas worse energy efficiency
- Clear recommendations
